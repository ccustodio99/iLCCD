# üõ† Job Order Module ‚Äì LCCD Integrated Information System

The **Job Order Module** lets LCCD stakeholders request repairs, installations,
and setups from a single form. It streamlines assignment and tracking so the
right department responds quickly and all actions are logged.

## üéØ Purpose

This module ensures work requests move smoothly through approval,
assignment, and completion while keeping requesters informed. It also
ties into requisitions so needed materials are on hand before work
begins.

## üß© Core Features

1. **Requests for Various Job Types**
   - Faculty, staff, and heads submit job orders for installations,
     maintenance, audits, emergencies, and other needs.
   - The form captures job type, description, optional attachments, and
     auto-fills the requester and department.
   - Job order types are managed under **Settings ‚Üí Job Order Types**.
   - When submitting a request, choose a **Type** first. A second dropdown then lists the available **Sub Types** for that category.
2. **Conversion from Tickets**
   - Maintenance-related tickets in the [Ticketing System Module](Ticketing_System_Module.md) can be converted directly into a job order.
   - The conversion carries over the description and requester so the workflow continues seamlessly.


3. **Post-Approval Assignment**
   - Once the configured approval workflow completes (default chain:
     Head ‚Üí President ‚Üí Finance when required), jobs route automatically
     to the correct team‚ÄîITRC, maintenance, or another office.
   - Both the assignee and requester receive notifications.

4. **Requesting Materials**
   - When a job requires supplies, the requester submits a [Requisition Management Module](requisition-management-module.md) entry for the needed items.
   - The requisition follows the normal approval workflow. Inventory is deducted only after the request is **approved**.
   - Once items are issued, the job order automatically advances to **approved** so it can be assigned.

5. **Evaluation and Execution Logging**
   - Jobs move through these workflow states:
     `pending_head` ‚Üí `pending_president` ‚Üí `pending_finance` ‚Üí `approved` ‚Üí `assigned` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed` ‚Üí `closed`.
   - Requesters close the job order once work is verified done. The system
     records the `closed_at` time for reporting.
   - Assigned personnel log start and finish times, actions taken, and
     any feedback from the requester.
   - All activity is recorded in the audit trail for transparency.

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface Design Notes

- Uses LCCD and CCS branding with navy, gold, and cyan colors.
- A single-page submission form and dashboard show job status and linked
  requisitions.
- Role-based views ensure requesters, approvers, and staff see only the
  actions relevant to them.
- The index page provides filters for status, job type, assigned staff,
  and a search box that matches words in the description. Closed job
  orders can be included via a checkbox.

## üîí Security & Audit Considerations

- Only authenticated users may create or act on job orders.
- Every step‚Äîfrom submission to closure‚Äîis logged.
- Attachments (downloadable) and saved in the [Document Management Module](document-management-module.md) are stored securely, and permission checks prevent
  unauthorized edits.
- Once a job order is approved at any stage, the requester can no longer
  edit it. Approvers may return the record to `pending_head` with a
  justification comment to restart the approval workflow.

## üìä Integration and Reporting

- Connects directly with the [Requisition Management Module](requisition-management-module.md), [Inventory Module](inventory-module.md), and [Ticketing System Module](Ticketing_System_Module.md).
- Feeds metrics such as completion time and material delays into the KPI
  dashboard.
- Reports can be exported for administration and finance review.
