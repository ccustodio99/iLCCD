# 🛠 Job Order Module – LCCD Integrated Information System

The **Job Order Module** lets LCCD stakeholders request repairs, installations,
and setups from a single form. It streamlines assignment and tracking so the
right department responds quickly and all actions are logged.

## 🎯 Purpose

This module ensures work requests move smoothly through approval,
assignment, and completion while keeping requesters informed. It also
ties into requisitions so needed materials are on hand before work
begins.

## 🧩 Core Features

1. **Requests for Repairs, Installations, and Setups**
   - Faculty, staff, and heads submit job orders for IT issues,
     facilities needs, or event setups.
   - The form captures job type, description, optional attachments, and
     auto-fills the requester and department.

2. **Post-Approval Assignment**
   - After multi-level approval (Head → President → Finance when
     required), jobs route automatically to the correct team—ITRC,
     maintenance, or another office.
   - Both the assignee and requester receive notifications.

3. **Triggering Material Requisitions**
   - When a job requires supplies, a linked requisition is created
     automatically.
   - Job status syncs with the requisition so work only begins once
     materials arrive.

4. **Evaluation and Execution Logging**
   - Jobs move through clear statuses: New → Approved → Assigned → In
     Progress → Completed → Closed.
   - Assigned personnel log start and finish times, actions taken, and
     any feedback from the requester.
   - All activity is recorded in the audit trail for transparency.

## 🖼️ User Interface Design Notes

- Uses LCCD and CCS branding with navy, gold, and cyan colors.
- A single-page submission form and dashboard show job status and linked
  requisitions.
- Role-based views ensure requesters, approvers, and staff see only the
  actions relevant to them.

## 🔒 Security & Audit Considerations

- Only authenticated users may create or act on job orders.
- Every step—from submission to closure—is logged.
- Attachments are stored securely, and permission checks prevent
  unauthorized edits.

## 📊 Integration and Reporting

- Connects directly with the Requisition and Inventory modules.
- Feeds metrics such as completion time and material delays into the KPI
  dashboard.
- Reports can be exported for administration and finance review.
