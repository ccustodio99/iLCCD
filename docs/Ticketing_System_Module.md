# 🎫 Ticketing System Module

The Ticketing System is the all-in-one portal for reporting issues and requesting services across LCCD. Students, faculty, and staff can log IT troubles, facility concerns, or document access needs from a single page. Each ticket auto-fills department details from the user profile and accepts optional attachments.

👉 **Smart routing:** Categories like IT, Facilities, or Documents send the ticket straight to the correct team. Department heads are notified instantly so nothing gets overlooked.

⏱️ **SLA monitoring:** Timers track how long tickets stay open. Critical requests escalate if they pass their deadline, ensuring urgent problems receive attention.

🔗 **Job orders & requisitions:** Complex issues may require a job order or extra supplies. Tickets can convert directly to job orders or link to requisitions, keeping workflow seamless. Progress updates reflect in the original ticket so users can follow along.

📊 **KPI integration:** Resolution times, escalation counts, and audit logs feed into the KPI dashboard for management insight. Every action is logged for accountability.

The interface uses Bootstrap 5 with official LCCD branding and is secured through the Access Control module. For more information on other modules, see the [documentation index](README.md).
