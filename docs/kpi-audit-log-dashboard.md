## üß© Core Features

### 1. Monitoring of Response Times, Approval Durations, and Completion Rates
- Tracks the entire lifecycle of requests, job orders, tickets, and requisitions.
- KPIs monitored include:
  - Average response time (from submission to first action)
  - Average approval duration per workflow stage
  - Completion rates per department, module, or user
  - Bottlenecks (e.g., where requests are delayed)
- Visual analytics (charts, tables) show trends over time.

### 2. Export Functionality to Excel for Analytics
- All KPI data, logs, and summaries can be exported to Excel format (.xlsx).
- Trigger export via the **Export** button or visit `/kpi-dashboard/export`.
- Export supports filters by date, department, module, user/role, and status.
- Enables further analysis by administration, finance, QA, or external auditors.

### 3. Role-Based Dashboard Views
- Dashboards display only data relevant to the user‚Äôs role and department:
  - **Administrators/ITRC**: All data, all modules, full logs
  - **Department Heads**: Department-specific KPIs, their requests and actions
  - **Finance**: All financial and procurement processes
  - **President**: Institutional-wide overview and critical metrics
- Customizable widgets and quick filters for user-centric experience.

### 4. Detailed Audit Logs of All Actions, with Optional Remarks
- Every significant action (create, update, approve, reject, return, delete) is logged with:
  - Timestamp, user, department, module, affected record, action details
  - Optional remarks/comments for context (e.g., reason for rejection)
- Immutable logs support compliance, forensics, and institutional transparency.
- Audit trail viewer allows filtering by user, action, date, or module.

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface Design Notes

## üîí Security & Audit Considerations
- Only authenticated users can view dashboards; data is limited by role.
- Exported files are watermarked for institutional use.
- Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted by users; only system admin can archive.
- Optional alerts for anomalies (e.g., repeated failed logins, unusual delays).

## üìä Integration and Reporting
- Pulls data from all modules: Tickets, Job Orders, Requisitions, POs, Inventory, etc.
- Supports accreditation, compliance, and QA reviews.
- Enables cross-module performance monitoring and strategic planning.
