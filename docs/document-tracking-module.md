# 🚚 Document Tracking Module – LCCD Integrated Information System

## 🎯 Purpose
The **Document Tracking Module** provides lightweight pages for monitoring incoming and outgoing documents, items awaiting approval, and general tracking or report views. It complements the Document Management module by giving users a quick way to review document flow across departments.

---

## 🧩 Core Features
- **Incoming Documents** – lists files received from other offices.
- **Outgoing Documents** – shows files sent out for processing or review.
- **For Approval** – displays documents that require checking or sign-off.
- **Tracking** – a consolidated view to check document status or location.
- **Reports** – placeholder page for future analytics and summaries.

All routes currently return a simple view, with no database interaction. The
logic is contained in `DocumentTrackingController`.

---

## 🖼️ User Interface Design Notes
- Pages use the standard layout defined in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`.
- Each view contains a heading and placeholder text (see `resources/views/documents/tracking/`).
- Navigation links to these sections appear only for authenticated users.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Access requires authentication (`auth` middleware in `routes/web.php`).
- Future enhancements may include permission checks per department.

## 🗂️ Code Overview
- **Routes**: Defined in `routes/web.php` under the `document-tracking` prefix. The
  endpoints are `incoming`, `outgoing`, `for-approval`, `tracking`, and `reports`.
- **Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/DocumentTrackingController.php` returns the
  corresponding views without additional logic.
- **Views**: Blade templates live in `resources/views/documents/tracking/` and
  extend the main `layouts.app` layout.

## 📊 Integration
- Designed to work alongside the [Document Management Module](document-management-module.md).
- Data from this module can feed into the [Document KPI & Log Dashboard](document-kpi-log-dashboard.md) once implemented.
