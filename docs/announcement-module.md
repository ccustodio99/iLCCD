# ðŸ“¢ Announcement Module â€“ LCCD Integrated Information System

System administrators can publish short messages that appear on the dashboard. Each announcement includes a title, rich content, and an active flag. Inactive records remain in the database but are hidden from users.

Announcements are managed under **Settings â†’ Announcements**. Admins may create, edit, or delete entries from this screen.
