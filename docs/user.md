# üë• User Management Module ‚Äì LCCD Integrated Information System

## üéØ Purpose

The User Management Module is responsible for the secure **creation**, **classification**, **maintenance**, and **monitoring** of user accounts across all departments of LCCD. It ensures that all stakeholders ‚Äî from students to department heads and administrators ‚Äî have appropriate and timely access to system functions based on their roles and responsibilities.

See the [Access Control Module](Access_Control_Module.md) for details on permission enforcement.
Users should also review the [User Manual](user_manual.md) for day-to-day actions.

## üß© Core Features

- Admin users can create, edit, or remove accounts.
  Self-service registration is available for new users and requires only the **Name**, **Email**, **Password**, and **Confirm Password** fields. Department and contact details can be set by an admin after the account is created.
- Each account includes:
  - Full name
  - Email / Username
  - Department
  - Contact information (phone number or other details)
  - Account photo (optional, defaults to `https://via.placeholder.com/150`)
- Passwords are hashed (e.g., bcrypt) and stored securely.
- Optional: Bulk user registration (CSV import).

### 2. Role Assignments and Permission Settings
- Roles are predefined and linked to system modules. Allowed roles are:
  `admin`, `staff`, `head`, `president`, `finance`, and `itrc`.
  Examples include:
  - **Faculty/Staff**: Can create tickets, requisitions, and job orders.
  - **Department Heads**: Can review/approve within their scope.
  - **President**: Strategic approval, high-level dashboards.
  - **Finance**: Budget validation, PO authorization.
  - **ITRC Admins**: Full system access, audit tools.
- Each role grants access to specific views and actions (using RBAC).

### 3. Departmental Affiliations and Access Controls
- Users are linked to departments (e.g., CCS, HR, Finance, Library).
- Requests, approvals, and dashboard access are filtered by department.
- Cross-departmental access is managed only by Admins or Super Admins.

### 4. Account Status Management
- **Activation**: Active accounts can log in and access modules based on their role.
- **Deactivation**: Used when:
  - Staff/faculty leave LCCD.
  - Access needs to be temporarily suspended.
- Disabled users are locked out, but their data is retained in logs and history.

### 5. Audit Trails
- All user-related actions are recorded with timestamp, user ID, IP address, and description:
  - Logins, logouts, failed login attempts
  - Profile updates and password changes
  - Access to sensitive modules
  - Role or department modifications
- Logs are stored in `storage/logs` and feed into the **Audit & KPI dashboard**.
  Each entry also includes the user's IP address for accountability.

### 6. Profile Management
- Each user can update their **name**, **email**, **contact information**, and password from the *My Profile* page.
- Password changes require confirmation and log an audit entry.
- Access via the Profile link in the left sidebar navigation when logged in.

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface Design Notes

- Branded with **LCCD and CCS department logos** (located in `public/assets/images/LCCD.jpg` and `public/assets/images/CCS.jpg`).
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
- Consistent layout with sidebar navigation and profile dropdown.
- Accessible color scheme (dark navy/gold and cyan highlights).
- Status indicators: green (active), gray (inactive), red (locked).

## üîí Security Considerations

- Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and minimum complexity rules.
- Optional 2FA via email or SMS.
- Automatic logout on inactivity.
- Access checks at both **front-end** and **controller-level**.
- Logs are immutable and monitored by ITRC.
### Current Implementation
- Users can register and log in with hashed passwords.
- Admins manage roles, departments, activation status, and can create accounts directly from the Users page.
- 2FA, password expiry, account lockout, and auto-logout are planned features.

### Password Policy & Session Management
- Minimum 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Passwords expire every 90 days and cannot be reused immediately
- Accounts lock for 15 minutes after 5 failed login attempts
- Sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity and IDs regenerate on login
- Changing a password invalidates all other active sessions

### Disabled Accounts
- Disabled users cannot authenticate or start new sessions
- Login attempts show an "Account disabled" message and are logged
- Administrators can reactivate accounts; historical data remains intact

## üìä Integration with Other Modules

- Requisitions, Job Orders, Tickets ‚Äî auto-fill department and user info.
- Approval routing is dynamically determined by user role and department.
- Reports filterable by user and role for KPI evaluation.

### Login Flow Example
1. User submits email and password on the login form
2. **User Management** verifies the account is active and not disabled
3. **Access Control** checks the password and records a login attempt
4. On success, a session is created and the session ID regenerates
5. User Management loads role and department data to personalize the dashboard
6. The login event is written to the audit log
