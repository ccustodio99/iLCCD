# üìù Requisition Management Module ‚Äì LCCD Integrated Information System

## üåü Purpose

## ü§ñ Core Features

### 1. Requests for Materials, Services, or Assets
- Users (faculty, staff, heads, president) can initiate requisitions for:
  - Office or teaching supplies
  - Facility or equipment repairs/services
  - Event support or operational needs
  - Any asset required for college operations
- Requisition forms include:
  - Item/service details (type, quantity, specifications)
  - Purpose/justification
  - Department and requester auto-filled
  - Optional attachments (quotations, specification sheets) stored with the request

### 2. Multi-Level Approval Workflows
- The system enforces a structured chain depending on the requester‚Äôs role:
  - **Staff**: Head ‚Üí President ‚Üí Finance
  - **Department Head**: President ‚Üí Finance
  - **President**: Finance only
- Each approval stage records **remarks** from the reviewer and is logged in the audit trail.
- Approvers simply advance the request to the next stage; the Finance office‚Äôs approval finalizes the requisition.

### 3. Automated Routing, Statuses, and Notifications
- Workflow engine automatically routes requests to the next required approver.
- Email notifications are sent to the next approver and to the requester whenever the status changes.
- Real-time status tracking uses these workflow states:
  - **pending_head** ‚Äì awaiting department head review
  - **pending_president** ‚Äì awaiting president approval
  - **pending_finance** ‚Äì awaiting finance approval
  - **approved** ‚Äì fully approved and ready for fulfillment
- Once a requisition moves beyond **pending_head**, the requester can no
  longer edit it. Approvers may return the request to **pending_head** with
  remarks when changes are needed, restarting the approval cycle.
- Requesters can monitor their requisitions and remarks via their dashboard.

### 4. Integration with Other Modules
- **Job Order Module**: Created automatically when a job order needs materials not in stock.
- **Inventory Module**: Approved requisitions trigger inventory checks and item issuance.
- **Purchase Order Module**: If requested item is out of stock, system can auto-generate a Purchase Order (PO) for Finance.
- **Audit Trail**: Every approval, modification, and comment is stored for compliance.
