# üìÅ Document Management Module ‚Äì LCCD Integrated Information System

## üéØ Purpose

The **Document Management Module** provides a secure, organized, and version-controlled repository for all important institutional documents, including policies, syllabi, and reports. It ensures that the right people have access to the right documents, every change is tracked, and documents are always associated with their relevant workflows.

## üß© Core Features

### 1. Version-Controlled Uploads of Policies, Syllabi, and Reports
- Users (faculty, staff, admins) can upload and update documents, with each upload saved as a new version.
- Old versions remain accessible for reference and compliance.
- Supports multiple file types: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, images, etc.
- Metadata: title, description, category (policy, syllabus, report, etc.), department, author, upload date, version number.

### 2. Secure, Role-Based Access
- Documents are categorized and access is controlled by user roles (e.g., faculty, student, admin) and department.
- Permission matrix determines who can view, upload, update, or archive documents.
- Sensitive files (e.g., contracts, student records) have stricter access rules and require elevated permissions.

### 3. Association with Requests or Tickets
- Documents can be linked to specific requests, requisitions, tickets, or job orders for full traceability.
- Example: Attach signed approvals to a requisition, or syllabus to a faculty request.
- Linked documents are displayed in the relevant module for quick access.

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Trails of Changes
- All document actions (upload, update, view, download, archive) are logged with:
  - User, timestamp, action performed, previous vs. new version, and reason (if provided).
- Audit logs support institutional compliance, reporting, and accountability.
- Admins can review all document history, revert to previous versions, or restore archived files.
