The user interface follows a mobileâ€‘first approach using **Bootstrap 5**. All
module tables are wrapped in a `table-responsive` container so they scroll
horizontally on small screens. The main navigation links to **Tickets**,
**Job Orders**, **Requisitions**, **Inventory**, **Purchase Orders**, and
**Documents** so moving between modules is quick and intuitive.

### Improved Navigation

- A **Skip to main content** link and a new **Back to Top** button help with
  keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Each standalone form page now includes a **Cancel** button that returns users
  to the list view without submitting changes.

### Form Guidelines

- Labels are always explicitly tied to form controls.
- Required fields use the `required` attribute and display validation errors.
- Submit buttons appear before the new Cancel link for better tab order.

### System Flow

- Tickets convert to Job Orders or Requisitions when needed.
- Requisitions automatically check Inventory and may create Purchase Orders.
- Documents and audit logs track every approval step.
