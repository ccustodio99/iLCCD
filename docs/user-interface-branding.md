The user interface follows a mobileâ€‘first approach using **Bootstrap 5**. All
module tables are wrapped in a `table-responsive` container so they scroll
horizontally on small screens. Navigation is provided via a hamburger button that
opens an offcanvas menu. It links to **Tickets**, **Job Orders**, **Requisitions**,
**Inventory**, **Purchase Orders**, and **Documents** so moving

between modules is quick and intuitive.

### UX Design Principles

The interface embraces seven core UX principles:

1. **User-centricity** â€“ forms preserve input and highlight required fields while
   confirmation messages guide each step.
2. **Consistency** â€“ all modules share the same palette and fonts. Administrators
   customize these in the [Theme Settings](system-settings.md#theme-settings) screen.
3. **Hierarchy** â€“ the active sidebar link and clear headings reveal where you
   are within the system.
4. **Context** â€“ breadcrumbs and page titles maintain orientation in multi-step
   workflows.
5. **User control** â€“ cancel buttons and a collapsible menu let you easily back
   out or explore.
6. **Accessibility** â€“ alt text, ARIA labels, skip links and keyboard-friendly
   toggles support every user.
7. **Usability** â€“ responsive layouts and quick AJAX updates keep tasks simple
   and fast.

### Improved Navigation

- A **Skip to main content** link and a new **Back to Top** button help with
  keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Each standalone form page now includes a **Cancel** button that returns users
  to the list view without submitting changes.

### Form Guidelines

- Labels are always explicitly tied to form controls.
- Required fields use the `required` attribute and display validation errors.
- Submit buttons appear before the new Cancel link for better tab order.

### System Flow

- Tickets convert to Job Orders or Requisitions when needed.
- Requisitions automatically check Inventory and may create Purchase Orders.
- Documents and audit logs track every approval step.

### Dashboard Performance

Data on the dashboard is now requested via AJAX from the `dashboard.data`
endpoint. This minimizes initial load time and keeps the interface responsive,
supporting the project's emphasis on user-centric feedback.
