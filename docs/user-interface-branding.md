The user interface follows a mobile-first approach using Bootstrap 5. All
module tables are wrapped in a `table-responsive` container so they scroll
horizontally on small screens. The main navigation now links to Tickets,
Job Orders, Requisitions, Inventory, Purchase Orders, and Documents to
make switching between modules quick and intuitive.
