The user interface follows a mobileâ€‘first approach using **Bootstrap 5**. All
module tables are wrapped in a `table-responsive` container so they scroll
horizontally on small screens. Navigation lives in a left sidebar that collapses
behind a hamburger button on mobile. It links to **Tickets**, **Job Orders**,
**Requisitions**, **Inventory**, **Purchase Orders**, and **Documents** so moving

between modules is quick and intuitive.

### UX Design Principles

The interface embraces seven core UX pillars:

1. **User-centricity** â€“ every page uses a clear title and retains form input on validation errors.
2. **Consistency** â€“ shared colors, fonts and layouts make each module feel familiar.
   Administrators can choose their preferred fonts and colors from the **Theme Settings** screen.
3. **Hierarchy** â€“ the active sidebar link highlights your current location.
4. **Context** â€“ descriptive titles and headings keep you oriented within the workflow.
5. **User control** â€“ cancel buttons and a collapsible menu allow easy navigation.
6. **Accessibility** â€“ skip links, ARIA labels and keyboard-friendly toggles support all users.
7. **Usability** â€“ responsive design and clear feedback keep tasks straightforward.

### Improved Navigation

- A **Skip to main content** link and a new **Back to Top** button help with
  keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Each standalone form page now includes a **Cancel** button that returns users
  to the list view without submitting changes.

### Form Guidelines

- Labels are always explicitly tied to form controls.
- Required fields use the `required` attribute and display validation errors.
- Submit buttons appear before the new Cancel link for better tab order.

### System Flow

- Tickets convert to Job Orders or Requisitions when needed.
- Requisitions automatically check Inventory and may create Purchase Orders.
- Documents and audit logs track every approval step.
