2. **Job Orders** – Request repairs or installations. Provide job details and upload supporting documents.
3. **Requisitions** – Request supplies or equipment from Inventory. Enter item names, quantities, and justification.
4. **Purchase Orders** – Finance staff convert approved requisitions into purchase orders for out‑of‑stock items.

Each module has status indicators so you can track approvals and fulfillment. See the individual module guides for full details.

## 📊 Tracking Progress
- The **My Tickets** or **My Requests** pages list everything you have submitted with their current status.
- Email alerts are sent whenever a ticket is created, assigned, updated, escalated, closed, or when someone comments. These notifications go to the ticket owner, the assigned user, and all watchers so everyone stays informed.
- For managers, the dashboard highlights pending approvals with quick links to review them.
- The **KPI & Audit Dashboard** aggregates performance metrics like response times and completion rates. Access it via the **KPI Dashboard** link or by visiting `/kpi-dashboard`.

### Ticket Watchers
When you create a ticket, the system automatically adds watchers so the right people stay informed. These include your department head (or head of office) and IT administrators. You may add more users as watchers if they need visibility on the issue. The ticket owner and the assigned user can update and close the ticket. Watchers receive the same email notifications as the owner, and they can comment but cannot modify or close the ticket.

Example email:

```
Subject: Ticket #42 updated

The ticket "Printer not working" has been escalated.
```
