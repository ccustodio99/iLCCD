## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating Requests
1. **Tickets** ‚Äì Report issues or service needs. Fill in the category, subject, description, and optional due date. Attach files if necessary. Ticket subjects display as `[Category] - [Issue Summary] - Ticket ID`.
2. **Job Orders** ‚Äì Request repairs or installations. First pick a **Type**, then choose a **Sub Type** from the list that appears. Provide job details and upload supporting documents.
3. **Requisitions** ‚Äì Request supplies or equipment from Inventory. Enter item names, quantities, and justification.
4. **Purchase Orders** ‚Äì Finance staff create purchase orders when requisitioned items are out of stock, low in stock, or when new items need to be purchased. Items can be selected from inventory or entered manually and then routed through approval.

Each module has status indicators so you can track approvals and fulfillment. See the individual module guides for full details.

## üìä Tracking Progress
- The **My Tickets** or **My Requests** pages list everything you have submitted with their current status.
- Email alerts are sent whenever a ticket is created, assigned, updated, escalated, closed, or when someone comments. These notifications go to the ticket owner, the assigned user, and all watchers so everyone stays informed.
- Archiving a ticket removes it from the active list and automatically sets the status to **Closed**.
- After department approval of a job order or requisition, linked tickets
  and orders are locked from editing by the requester. Approvers can send
  them back to **pending** with remarks when revisions are needed.
- Staff who need to revise a closed or approved ticket may use the **Request Edit** action.
  A justification is required and the ticket status resets to **open** so the
  approval workflow restarts from the beginning.
- For managers, the dashboard highlights pending approvals with quick links to review them.
- The **KPI & Audit Dashboard** aggregates performance metrics like response times and completion rates. Access it via the **KPI Dashboard** link or by visiting `/kpi-dashboard`.

### Ticket Watchers
When you create a ticket, the system automatically adds watchers so the right people stay informed. These include your department head (or head of office) and IT administrators. You may add more users as watchers if they need visibility on the issue. The ticket owner and the assigned user can update and close the ticket. Watchers receive the same email notifications as the owner, and they can comment but cannot modify or close the ticket.

Example email:

```
Subject: Ticket #42 updated

The ticket "Printer not working" has been escalated.
```

## üîí Access and Permissions
