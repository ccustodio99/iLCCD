# üé¨ Demo Guide ‚Äì LCCD Integrated Information System

## üöÄ Purpose
This guide provides a structured approach for demonstrating the LCCD Integrated Information System. It includes a step-by-step flow, sample scripts, credentials, data, and scenarios for showcasing key features.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Flow
1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies.
2. **Prepare the environment** using the provided `.env.example` as a template.
3. **Run database migrations and seeders** (`php artisan migrate --seed`) to load the demo dataset.
4. **Launch the local server** and log in with the demo accounts.
5. **Walk through core modules** such as Ticketing, Job Orders, and Inventory.
6. **Highlight approval workflows, notifications, and audit logs.**

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scripts to Run
```bash
# Install PHP and JS dependencies
composer install
npm install && npm run build

# Migrate and seed demo data
php artisan migrate --seed # runs DemoSeeder
# (DocumentCategorySeeder runs first to create default categories)

# Start the local server
php artisan serve
```
These commands assume a local development setup with PHP, Composer, Node.js, and npm installed.

*Passwords are intentionally generic for demo purposes only.*

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Data
Running the seeders will create demo accounts for all major roles and sample records for every module. The default dataset now includes **five tickets** *(one archived and closed)*, **three job orders**, **four requisitions**, **eight inventory items**, **two purchase orders**, and **three documents with version history**. Each record also creates sample **ticket comments**, **requisition items**, and **inventory transactions** with matching audit logs. Modify `database/seeders/DemoSeeder.php` if you want to adjust the content.
The demo seeder reuses the document categories seeded by `DocumentCategorySeeder` so demo documents fall under **Policies & Procedures**, **Forms & Templates**, and **Course Materials**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Scenarios
1. **Ticket Creation and Escalation** ‚Äì Submit a ticket as a user, then demonstrate automated SLA escalation.
2. **Job Order Workflow** ‚Äì Convert a ticket into a job order and show approval steps.
3. **Inventory Checkout** ‚Äì Issue an item from inventory and display stock updates.
4. **Access Control** ‚Äì Log in as different roles to illustrate permissions.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Tips
- Reset the database with `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` if you need a clean slate.
- Emphasize branding elements (logos, colors, fonts) during the walkthrough.
- Keep the `.env` file out of version control and never expose real credentials.
