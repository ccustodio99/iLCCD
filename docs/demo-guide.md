## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Flow
1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies.
2. **Prepare the environment** using the provided `.env.example` as a template.
3. **Run database migrations and seeders** to populate demo data.
4. **Launch the local server** and log in with the demo accounts.
5. **Walk through core modules** such as Ticketing, Job Orders, and Inventory.
6. **Highlight approval workflows, notifications, and audit logs.**

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scripts to Run
```bash
# Install PHP and JS dependencies
composer install
npm install && npm run build

# Migrate and seed demo data
php artisan migrate --seed

# Start the local server
php artisan serve
```
These commands assume a local development setup with PHP, Composer, Node.js, and npm installed.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Credentials
| Role  | Email               | Password |
|-------|---------------------|----------|

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Data
The seeders create sample tickets, job orders, requisitions, and inventory items. You can modify the seed files in `database/seeders/` to tailor the demo content.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Scenarios
1. **Ticket Creation and Escalation** ‚Äì Submit a ticket as a user, then demonstrate automated SLA escalation.
2. **Job Order Workflow** ‚Äì Convert a ticket into a job order and show approval steps.
3. **Inventory Checkout** ‚Äì Issue an item from inventory and display stock updates.
4. **Access Control** ‚Äì Log in as different roles to illustrate permissions.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Tips
- Reset the database with `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` if you need a clean slate.
- Emphasize branding elements (logos, colors, fonts) during the walkthrough.
- Keep the `.env` file out of version control and never expose real credentials.
