## 🔧 Local Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (see `.env` in the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure-laravel)).
2. Run `php artisan key:generate` to create the application encryption key.
3. Configure database settings in `.env` then run `php artisan migrate` to create the tables.
4. Run `php artisan storage:link` so uploaded attachments are accessible.

## 🔄 System Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User submits Ticket/Requisition/Job Order]
    B[System auto-routes by type/role]
    C[Multi-stage approvals: Head→President→Finance]
    D[Assignment (IT/Facilities/HR/etc)]
    E[Inventory/PO check—auto-deduct or create PO]
    F[Job/Order/Request executed]
    DM[Documents stored]
    G[KPI & audit logs updated]
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> DM --> G
```
Every action is traceable; every step is value-aligned.

**Workflow summary:**
1. Every process begins with a **Ticket**.
2. Tickets can convert to a **Job Order** (for maintenance/setup) or directly to a **Requisition**.
3. Job Orders check **Inventory** for required materials; missing items create a linked Requisition.
4. Approved Requisitions deduct from Inventory or spawn a **Purchase Order** when stock is unavailable (handled by Finance).
5. All related files—approvals, receipts, instructions—are archived in **Document Management**.
